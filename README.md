## Created by Hashim Gari for Mod 1 Week 1 Project

#### Game Mechanics

A standard deck of 52 cards are split between two players. Every round, each player will take the top card from their deck will perform a comparison. One outcome of several will occur:

A. If the face value of each player's card are not equal, then whomever has the higher face value card wins both cards. Those cards are placed at the bottom of the winner's deck. New round starts.

B. If the face value of each player's card are equal then there is a WAR. In war, each player will place their next three cards onto a spoils pile. Each player will then draw their next card from their deck and one of two outcomes will occur:

  a) If the face value of each player's card are not equal, then whomever has the higher face value card wins all the cards on the spoils pile. Those cards are placed at the bottom of the winner's deck. New round starts.

  b)If the face value of each player's card are equal, then mutually assured destruction occurs. The six cards on the spoils pile are then discarded from the game and a new round starts.

A winner of the game is determined when a player no longer has enough cards to play the game.
